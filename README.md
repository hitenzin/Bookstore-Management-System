Our system has four types of users: Visitors, Registered Users, Sellers, and Super Users. Users can only browse and search books, while registered users can buy books and sellers can buy and sell books. In addition, registered users can rate, comment, complain on books and sellers. Both the registered users and sellers are managed and administered by the supers users. Super users can upgrade a register user to seller, blacklist a seller, cancel an account, etc.
